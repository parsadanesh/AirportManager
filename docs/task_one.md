# Task One - The benefits of this software

## Introduction

An airport is a very dangerous place, if not managed correctly. Each day hundreds of planes are flying in and out, carrying thousands of passengers that expect to make it to their destinations. It is the job of air traffic controllers and pilots to coordinate the landings and take offs in a safe manner so that accidents do not arise, without this coordination pilots are blind to their surroundings when trying to land and take off. This software aims to fix this issue, the program creates a representation of the clients airport that can be used to control the flow of planes at the airport.  Air Traffic Controllers can use this software to help safely manage the influx and efflux of planes at the airport to keep a steady flow of safe flights. From aiding with decisions, to keeping track of planes, this program will make this airport much safer and easier to manage.

## The benefits of using this software

- **Control The Congestion** - Air Traffic Controllers will be able to tell planes when it is time to land and when it is time to take off. This is important because there should be a steady flow of flights and this software allows Air Traffic Controller to control the flow.

- **Increase Safety** - Air Traffic Controllers will be able to tell not to land when the airports capacity is reached, the airport has a capacity for a reason and if the airport exceeds this capacity there would be no space for the plane increasing the potential of an accident occurring.

- **Easier Management** - The system will allow the user to change the maximum capacity to make an accurate representation of the airport, it will also keep track of which planes are at the airport. By using these two features the Air Traffic Controllers will be able to manage the airport.

## The risks associated with the software

- **Human Error** - As part of the system the capacity can be changed by Air Traffic Controllers and the client this means there is a possibility of human error causing a risk to the safety. If the incorrect data is inputted from the Air Traffic Controllers then it could lead to accidents.

- **Crashes** - Since this is an electronic system there is a potential for the program to crash if it loses its power. Without a backup power source the system would go down.
